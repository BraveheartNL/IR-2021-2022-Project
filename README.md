**Project Goal Description**

In this project, you will implement popularity-based, feature-based and collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms. You will then train and evaluate the resulting algorithms on publicly available dataset\(s\), contrasting the performance and the recommendations of your models. Finally, you will reflect on your findings; e.g., discuss the limitations of your algorithms, how well they are suited for your chosen data and outline any possible future research directions.

**Algorithms**

The following algorithems were chosen:

- Popularity-based/Community Based - True Bayesian Estimate
- Feature-based - Genre based Vector Space Model
- Collaborative Filtering - truncated Singular Value Decomposition

**Evaluation**

The following evaluation techniques are used:

- NCDG
- Wilcoxon signed rank test
- Wilcoxon signed sum test
